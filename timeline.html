													From connecting breadboards like Legos to programming microcontrollers; Meet Careen, one of the participants from our Dec-Jan special program and currently an intern at a STEM center in Arusha.“I remember my first program was to blink an LED and… I couldn’t believe that a microcontroller was following my instructions! Despite graduating from secondary school, my knowledge of electronics/circuitry was mostly theoretical and not to mention programming which I never heard about before.Through this hands-on and beginner-friendly experience, I quickly gained an understanding of and the real-life applications of technical concepts. I have also discovered the simplicity and versatility of the Arduino platform, making it easy for even a beginner like me to quickly produce working prototypes.This newfound knowledge has furthered my interest in engineering & Technology and I can already start to see how I could possibly benefit my community. And I know it doesn't have to be big, just helping a few more students to learn about this could be somewhere to start.In all I'm grateful for the opportunity to be part of this program, am looking forward to encouraging and helping more young people find their passion for creating and developing!"

													<p>It has been a hectic and exciting time for us; In the past few months, we continuously pushed to increase our reach to more youngsters across regions in Tanzania. This time, The Safari stopped by in the Arusha region…over two months, we worked to identify and select some of the best and brightest students in science/engineering subjects from over ten schools across the region. We set up a physical center at E3Empower and curated a rigorous and fast-paced program covering a wide range of skills, from programming to hardware integration.While we shall extend our activities to other regions in the coming year, the activities at the center in Arusha will continue. This is an excellent opportunity for Youngsters in Arusha who needs a platform to nurture their skills in Technology; We encourage them to reach out to us for placement in our program.</p>

													Typically, Our workshops at a destination last between 7 and 14 days. Because of this, We frequently have to answer one question: "In such a short timescale, practically what do you think the participants gain?"Our delivery employs particular instructing approaches to account for the short timescale and zero prior experience.We mainly focus on project-based and just-in-time learning approaches. This way, much time is devoted to developing relevant skills for the specific projects participants are working on, instead of dealing with the steep curve of strictly understanding each theoretical concepts. This is usually enough to quantify their understanding of practical applications of the concepts and design thinking - our primary objective, as well as to measure our impact during that "short timescale." <strong>#tmeeducation</strong>

												<p>Over the past months, TheTechSafari extended its roots to the Eastern part of Tanzania, from Tanga through Dar-es-Salaam to Mwanza through Kilimanjaro. It was indeed a ‘Safari,’ but the number of hours spent on the road became insignificant, looking at the number of talents in our spotlight during our operations.

												Recap: Moving from Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania Open Innovation Org.. (@toio_tz ) coordinated and set the next hotspot in Tanga at @stemparktanga , where we run ‘thetechsprint’ holiday program.
												‘Thetechsprint’ was a summer program bringing together individuals who worked on several technical projects addressing different problems in their communities. During the program, the participants were exposed to various relevant concepts ranging from design thinking which helped them to come up with practical problems, to electronics and programming essential for bringing their imagined solutions to life.
												
												Toward the end, the participants pitched/presented unique projects ranging from intelligent blind aid sticks, autonomous security systems, USSD code-based marketplace, and intelligent parking systems, to mention a few. All this in a minimal timeframe, and considering they had no previous experience, we can only imagine what they will be able to achieve in the near future…
												
												Thanks to TME education, the main sponsors of these workshops.

													With project-based learning, we not only make it easier for students to grasp abstract concepts, we also leave a long lasting impression.
													While tackling some seemingly daunting challenges, at the start you couldn't miss to see the looks of determination (and occasional frustrating) but which quickly turned into big smiles of accomplishment once they figured their way through.
